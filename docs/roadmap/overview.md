# Roadmap Overview

This page provides an overview of the Karned Rekipe project roadmap, explaining how it's organized and how to use it effectively.

## Purpose of the Roadmap

The roadmap serves several key purposes:

1. **Planning**: Outline the future development of the Karned Rekipe platform
2. **Tracking**: Monitor progress on various features and components
3. **Communication**: Share the project status and plans with stakeholders
4. **Prioritization**: Identify which tasks should be tackled first

## Roadmap Structure

The roadmap is organized into three main sections:

1. **[To Do](todo.md)**: Tasks that are planned but not yet started
2. **[In Progress](in-progress.md)**: Tasks currently being worked on
3. **[Completed](completed.md)**: Tasks that have been finished

## Task Format

Each task in the roadmap follows a consistent format:

```markdown
### Task Name

**Priority**: High/Medium/Low
**Estimated Time**: X days/weeks
**Assigned To**: Team member name(s) or TBD
**Dependencies**: Other tasks that must be completed first (if any)

Detailed description of the task, including specific requirements, goals, and any other relevant information.
```

## How to Update the Roadmap

To move a task between states (e.g., from "To Do" to "In Progress"):

1. Cut the task from its current file (e.g., `todo.md`)
2. Paste it into the appropriate file (e.g., `in-progress.md`)
3. Update any relevant information (assignees, estimated completion date, etc.)

This approach allows for easy tracking of progress and ensures that the roadmap remains up-to-date.

## Roadmap Visualization

The roadmap can be visualized in different ways:

- **Timeline View**: Tasks organized by expected completion date
- **Component View**: Tasks organized by system component
- **Priority View**: Tasks organized by priority level

These views can be generated from the information in the roadmap files.

## Roadmap Reviews

The roadmap should be reviewed regularly (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly) to:

1. Update task statuses
2. Adjust priorities if needed
3. Add new tasks as they are identified
4. Remove or archive completed tasks

Regular reviews ensure that the roadmap remains an accurate reflection of the project's status and plans.
