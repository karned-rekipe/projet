# Getting Started

This guide will help you get started with the API Recipe service.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- Access to the Karned platform

## Installation

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karned-rekipe/api-recipe.git
   cd api-recipe
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Docker Deployment

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t api-recipe --platform=linux/amd64 .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 api-recipe
   ```
